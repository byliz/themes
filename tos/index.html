<p>For personal, legal, and business reasons, I prefer to keep all communication about freelance matters in written form for my records, so I will only accept communication through <strong>email</strong> and <strong>text message</strong>. Phone calls will go straight to voicemail, and I do not accept inquiries through social media because they could easily get lost. If your message is about commissions, please send me an email or text message instead, and I will get back to you within 24 hours.</p>

<ul>
